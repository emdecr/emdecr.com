I joined the Hypenotic team in 2015, shortly after graduating from Juno College’s (formerly HackerYou) Full-Time Front-End Web Development Immersive.

Hypenotic is a founding Canadian B Corp, made up of strategic, creative, and technical problem-solvers based in Toronto. The team focuses on working with visionary entrepreneurs, innovative non-profits, and intrapreneurs committed to systems change.

Rather than individual case studies, this is a condensed look at how I grew alongside the team — technically, professionally, and personally — over four+ years.

## Early Years: WordPress Foundations

I started with pure WordPress theming, getting deeply familiar with the Codex and PHP. Custom fields and custom post types quickly became my comfort zone.

I began leading development on client sites early on, which came with valuable lessons in both failure and recovery — including learning how to stay calm, debug methodically, and turn mistakes into repeatable processes.

## Experimentation: WordPress REST API & Headless Thinking

When WordPress released the REST API as a plugin in 2015, I started experimenting with what it could enable.

The question became less *“Can we do this?”* and more *“When does this meaningfully improve our work?”*

This curiosity led us to explore a headless CMS approach, opening the door to more flexible front-end architectures.

## Expanding the Stack: React, Vue, and Mentorship

As JavaScript frameworks gained traction, I wanted to understand them deeply — not just follow hype.

I started with React, then explored Vue.js. While both were powerful, we ultimately invested in Vue due to its clearer syntax, approachable architecture, and faster onboarding for new developers.

Around this time, the dev team began to grow. Onboarding interns and new hires meant shifting from “just building” to:
- Creating space for experimentation
- Establishing shared patterns
- Informally designing a curriculum that balanced learning with delivery

## Scaling Thoughtfully: Nuxt, SSR, Infrastructure & Delegation

As our Vue applications grew, we hit a key limitation: lack of server-side rendering.

I advocated for adopting Nuxt, allowing us to build universal (SSR) applications that better served client needs around SEO and performance.

This phase also involved:
- Building custom WordPress REST API endpoints
- Writing more complex SQL queries
- Overhauling deployment infrastructure on Linode
- Introducing NGINX and PM2

As systems matured, so did my role — delegating more, trusting others with ownership, and focusing on higher-level decisions.

## Final Year: Team Growth & Letting Go

In my final year, newer developers stepped into project-lead roles. Watching that transition was one of the most rewarding parts of my time at Hypenotic.

It felt like a natural closing of a loop — from being supported, to supporting others, to stepping back and letting the team thrive.

## Closing

Those four+ years shaped how I think about technology, teamwork, and responsibility. I learned how to help grow systems *and* people — and how to care deeply without holding too tightly.

Thanks for everything, folks. ❤️
