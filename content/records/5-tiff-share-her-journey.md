I’m a film fan and a Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) member.

In 2017, TIFF launched **Share Her Journey**, an initiative aimed at increasing participation, skills, and opportunities for women both behind and in front of the camera. As someone who deeply values representation, I decided to show my support by making a donation.

Later that year, I received the initiative’s results report via email — delivered as a PDF.

I loved seeing the outcomes and progress, but I immediately wondered:

**What if this lived beyond a static document?**

## From PDF to Webpage

The report clearly wasn’t intended as a widely circulated asset — it directly thanked supporters — but the work itself deserved broader visibility.

So I decided to explore an alternative format and quickly **designed and developed a webpage version of the report**:

## Why a Webpage?

A web-based report opens up possibilities that a PDF simply can’t:

- **Shareability**  
  A webpage is easier to circulate, link to, and reference — especially beyond an existing donor base.

- **Responsiveness**  
  The content adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

- **Purposeful motion**  
  Subtle animations reinforce meaning rather than distract from it.  
  For example, the counter animation in the light-blue *Social* section visually emphasizes growth.

- **Embedded social content**  
  Tweets and Instagram posts can be embedded directly, allowing readers to engage and click through.

- **Clear calls to action**  
  Donation CTAs are immediately accessible, making it easy for inspired readers to act.

## Closing the Loop

I shared the webpage and these thoughts with the Share Her Journey team — not as criticism, but simply to say thank you and to offer ideas that might inform future reports.

The next morning, I received a thoughtful response from the team, along with an invitation to chat about the mock site and the initiative.

I’m grateful they took the time to engage, and even more grateful for the work they continue to do in supporting women in the film community.

Here’s to more stories being told — by all kinds of people.
