> …putting new actors into the same system will not improve the system's performance.

This echoes Lou Downe’s mention of **Conway’s Law** in *Good Services*. The law states that:

> Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.

In other words, the product, service, or result is *infused with the essence of its creators*.[^1]

Downe goes on to say that siloed organizations result in siloed services — and that a lack of diversity within a team leads to a lack of inclusion in the service itself.

I bought the two stickers seen below from Lou Downe’s shop, and they now sit on my windowsill as a small but persistent reminder.[^2]

Thinking this way makes me look at the systems we’ve put in place across society and think:

*Duh. Of course we’re where we are today.*

Look at our foundations.  
The boundaries we’ve crossed.  
The lives we’ve silenced.  
The voices we’ve magnified.  
The values we’ve allowed to proliferate.

I can feel upset about this — and I often do — but I can also zoom in and recognize how a person’s decisions (my own “odd” or “bad” ones included) often feel rational within the network of information they have available to them.

That’s not an excuse for harmful behaviour.  
But it *does* offer insight into why behaviour manifests at all.

And for me, that understanding helps soften the anger — just enough — so I can switch into a mode that lets me move forward instead of staying stuck.
