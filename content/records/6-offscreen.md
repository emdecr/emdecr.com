For those of you who’ve interacted with me in person or via content on the interwebs, you probably know that I’m a fan of the indie magazine [Offscreen](https://www.offscreenmag.com/).

In February, I sent [Kai Brach](https://www.brizk.com/) (Offscreen’s Editor) an email sharing how Offscreen has shaped my perspective over the years I’ve been a reader. He’s always been engaged and thoughtful in his responses, and ended up asking if I’d be interested in contributing to the issue’s *“Ten Things I’ve Learned”* section — essentially a list of lessons I’ve picked up while working in tech.

To be honest, I was a bit hesitant because:

- this was coming from a publication I really respected  
- impostor syndrome

…But:

- I was chuffed at even being asked and trusted Kai’s judgment  
- I wanted to work on externalizing some of my thoughts  
- I accepted the discomfort and worked past that bout of impostor syndrome

The entire experience was genuinely collaborative, and all of Kai’s feedback was incredibly helpful. The issue is illustrated by [Agnes Lee](https://ahjlee.com/) due to COVID-19’s impact on physical human interaction (including photoshoots), and the result is a piece of work that feels especially thoughtful and lovely.

I’ve always felt that Kai is sensitive to how Offscreen reflects and speaks to broader societal issues, which is why I respect [his note on Offscreen’s lack of diversity](https://www.offscreenmag.com/blog/issue-23-out-now).

As humans, we err — but we can also acknowledge, learn, and shift our behaviour and actions. We try to grow together.

Congrats to Kai and the Offscreen team on another issue!
