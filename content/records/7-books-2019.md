Some of these are novels, some are children’s books, some are magazines with long-form content, and some fall into the *other* category.

## Themes that popped up

- **Introspection and belief change**  
  This year was about digging into *why* I believed what I believed. Questioning whether certain beliefs deserved a place in my life, or whether they were burdensome defense mechanisms — or simply didn’t serve me or the people around me. It felt like an existential audit. Not always pleasant, but deeply educational.

- **Leadership and team values**  
  What makes a good leader? What kind of leadership do I respect? What kind of leader do I want to be? What makes a team click and thrive?

- **Ethics**  
  Mostly in relation to technology and research.

I added a note and/or a favorite quotation from some of the reads. Enjoy!
