## Overview

In the summer of 2018, while working full-time at Hypenotic, I was accepted into the inaugural cohort of **Intro to UX Research**, run by the User Experience Research Collective (UXRC) – now the team behind [Learners Collective](https://joinlearners.com/).

For our final project, our cohort partnered with the **[City of Toronto’s Vision Zero initiative](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/road-safety/vision-zero/vision-zero-plan-overview/)**, which is grounded in the belief that traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries are preventable and should be reduced to zero.

Our guiding research question was:

> **In the context of road safety, when do pedestrians or cyclists in Toronto feel most at risk of injury, and how do they change their behaviour to compensate?**

## Defining the Focus

Each student selected a specific subpopulation to research. I chose to focus on:

- **Pedestrians**
- **Newcomers to Canada (within the past five years)**

There were two reasons for this choice:

1. Pedestrians would be easier to recruit and interview within the project timeline.
2. The newcomer experience is personally meaningful to me — both of my parents emigrated to Canada from the Philippines — and represents a wide range of lived experiences.

---

## Research Goals

- Understand how newcomer pedestrians perceive road safety
- Identify behavioural adaptations made in response to perceived risk
- Explore how early experiences shape long-term habits and beliefs

---

## Interview Design

To ground the research, I used **Statistics Canada’s definition of “newcomer”** (individuals who arrived in Canada within the past five years).

I structured interviews around three phases:

### Background
What were the streets like in participants’ previous countries?  
How might prior environments shape current behaviour?

### Early Experiences in Canada
What stood out when they first arrived?  
Were there moments that cemented beliefs around safety or risk?

### Current Habits
How do participants navigate Toronto streets today?  
What behaviours have persisted, changed, or faded over time?

---

## Recruitment & Fieldwork

I created a recruitment email and Google Form to organize responses and reached out to community organizations supporting newcomers and their families.

- **Participants:** 10 newcomer pedestrians  
- **Gender split:** 50% men / 50% women  
- **Interview length:** ~1 hour each  
- **Locations:** Homes, libraries, community centres, parks  
- **Compensation:** $30 gift card  

All interviews were conducted with informed consent and audio-recorded.

## Synthesis & Analysis

After transcribing the interviews, I conducted a thematic analysis to identify recurring patterns.

While the original research question focused on *when* risk occurs and *what behaviours* follow, a broader narrative emerged:

> Many participants described a period of heightened vigilance immediately after arriving in Canada, followed by a gradual normalization of risk over time.

---

## Reframing the Findings

During a practice presentation, UXRC instructor **Alec Levin** offered feedback that shifted my approach:

> What you’re describing feels like a journey. This would be clearer and more impactful as a timeline.

This reframing helped transform the findings into a **journey model**, mapping how perceptions and behaviours evolved from arrival to settlement.

---

## Key Insights (TL;DR)

### Earlier intervention
- Participants recalled being highly attentive when first arriving
- Pedestrian safety was rarely mentioned in official newcomer materials
- Early education often came from peers, not trusted authorities

### Missed touchpoints
- Many newcomers didn’t connect with community organizations until much later
- This delay may limit the effectiveness of safety education

### Open questions
- Could early hyper-vigilance be leveraged for better retention of safety behaviours?
- How might government or community organizations reach newcomers earlier and more consistently?

## Reflections & What I’d Do Differently

Language was a meaningful constraint. While there was no complete language barrier, nuances were sometimes lost. Participants and I occasionally relied on Google Translate, sketches, and gestures to communicate concepts.

In a future iteration, I would:
- Offer translators where desired
- Build more time into interviews for clarification
- Explore multilingual research materials

Most importantly, this project reinforced for me that **interviews are conversations between humans**, not just data collection exercises.

## Closing Thoughts

Even though this project moved away from direct policy stewardship, it deepened my curiosity about how we foster care and responsibility toward others in shared spaces.

How do we move beyond pamphlets and checklists?  
How might people see themselves as active participants in collective safety?
