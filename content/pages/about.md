Hi, I'm Emily ðŸ‘‹ â€“ I go by 'she/her' pronouns.

I'm currently a web developer. Previously, I worked with the folks at [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/), [Nylas](https://www.nylas.com/), [Hypenotic](https://hypenotic.com) and the [Re:searching for LGBTQ2S+ Health team](https://www.lgbtqhealth.ca/) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH).

In university, I double-majored in psychology and English â€“ I'm always thinking about the stories behind people's behaviour. While I've mainly honed my coding skills over the past few years, I'm also interested in learning more about research.

I take on freelance projects when I can. Here's what I think about when looking for people to work alongside. Sound like you or have questions? Let's chat.
