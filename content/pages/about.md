Hi, I'm Emily 👋 – I go by 'she/her' pronouns.

I'm currently a web developer. Previously, I worked with the folks at [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/), [Nylas](https://www.nylas.com/), [Hypenotic](https://hypenotic.com) and the [Re:searching for LGBTQ2S+ Health team](https://www.lgbtqhealth.ca/) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH).

My background in psychology and English informs how I approach user needs, communication, and system structure — and over the last several years I’ve applied that perspective to building, improving, and maintaining web platforms end-to-end.

I take on freelance projects when I can. If you’re looking for someone who can jump into complex systems, bring clarity, and ship reliably, [I’d love to connect](mailto:hello@emilydelacruz.com).
